# Development Workflow

Now that you know the fundamentals, let's learn how to actually contribute to our team's projects. This guide covers our complete workflow from picking up a task to getting your code merged.

## Overview of Our Process

1. Pick or get assigned a task
2. Create a feature branch
3. Develop and test your changes
4. Commit your work
5. Push your branch
6. Create a Pull Request
7. Code review and feedback
8. Merge to main
9. Celebrate! 🎉

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Set Up Your Local Environment

Before starting any work:

```bash
# Make sure you're on main branch
git checkout main

# Get the latest changes
git pull origin main

# Make sure dependencies are up to date
npm install
```

### 2. Pick a Task

![Github Issues](/img/Github_Issues.png)

Tasks are usually tracked in:
- **GitHub Issues** - Check the project's Issues tab
- **Project Board** - Kanban-style board with tasks
- **Team Meetings** - Tasks assigned directly by leads

Look for tasks labeled:
- `good first issue` - Perfect for beginners
- `beginner-friendly` - Doesn't require advanced knowledge
- `help wanted` - Team needs someone to tackle this

### 3. Create Your Branch

Use our branching naming convention:

```bash
# For new features
git checkout -b feature/descriptive-name

# For bug fixes
git checkout -b bugfix/descriptive-name

# For hot fixes (urgent production issues)
git checkout -b hotfix/descriptive-name
```

**Examples:**
```bash
git checkout -b feature/add-user-profile
git checkout -b feature/dark-mode-toggle
git checkout -b bugfix/fix-login-redirect
git checkout -b bugfix/navbar-responsive-issue
```

### 4. Develop Your Feature

#### Start the Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
# or
npm start
```

#### Make Your Changes
- Write clean, readable code
- Follow the project's coding style
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep components small and focused

#### Test As You Go
- Test your changes in the browser
- Check different screen sizes (responsive design)
- Try edge cases (empty inputs, long text, etc.)
- Make sure existing features still work

### 5. Write Good Commits

Commit frequently with clear messages:

```bash
# Check what you've changed
git status
git diff

# Stage your changes
git add src/components/UserProfile.tsx
git add src/styles/profile.css

# Or stage all changes
git add .

# Commit with a descriptive message
git commit -m "feat: add user profile component with avatar and bio"
```

#### Commit Message Guidelines

Format: `<type>: <description>`

**Types:**
- `feat:` - New feature
- `fix:` - Bug fix
- `docs:` - Documentation changes
- `style:` - Code formatting (not CSS)
- `refactor:` - Code restructuring
- `test:` - Adding tests
- `chore:` - Maintenance tasks

**Good Examples:**
```bash
git commit -m "feat: add dark mode toggle to navbar"
git commit -m "fix: resolve login redirect issue on Safari"
git commit -m "refactor: extract form validation into custom hook"
git commit -m "docs: update README with installation steps"
```

**Bad Examples:**
```bash
git commit -m "changes"
git commit -m "fix stuff"
git commit -m "asdf"
git commit -m "this should work now hopefully"
```

### 6. Push Your Branch

```bash
# First time pushing this branch
git push -u origin feature/your-feature-name

# Subsequent pushes
git push
```

### 7. Create a Pull Request (PR)

#### On GitHub:
1. Go to the repository page
2. Click "Pull Requests" tab
3. Click "New Pull Request"
4. Select your branch
5. Fill out the PR template

#### PR Title
Use the same format as commit messages:
```
feat: Add user profile component
fix: Resolve navbar responsive issues
```

#### PR Description Template
```markdown

### 8. Code Review Process

After creating your PR:

1. **Automated Checks** run (linting, tests, builds)
2. **Team members review** your code
3. **Feedback is provided** via comments
4. **You address feedback** and push updates
5. **Approval** when everything looks good

#### Responding to Feedback

When reviewers leave comments:

```bash
# Make requested changes
# ... edit files ...

# Stage and commit
git add .
git commit -m "refactor: address PR feedback - extract validation logic"

# Push updates
git push
```

**Tips:**
- Don't take feedback personally - it makes everyone better
- Ask questions if you don't understand
- Thank reviewers for their time
- Learn from the suggestions

### 9. Keep Your Branch Updated

If `main` gets updated while you're working:

```bash
# Save your current work
git add .
git commit -m "work in progress"

# Get latest main
git checkout main
git pull

# Go back to your branch
git checkout feature/your-feature

# Merge main into your branch
git merge main

# Or rebase (cleaner history, but more advanced)
git rebase main

# If there are conflicts, resolve them
# Then push (may need --force if you rebased)
git push
```

### 10. After Your PR is Merged

```bash
# Switch back to main
git checkout main

# Pull the latest changes (includes your work!)
git pull

# Delete your local branch (optional but clean)
git branch -d feature/your-feature

# Delete remote branch (optional)
git push origin --delete feature/your-feature
```

## Development Best Practices

### Before Starting
- [ ] Make sure you understand the task
- [ ] Ask questions if anything is unclear
- [ ] Check if similar code exists you can reference
- [ ] Set up your environment properly

### While Developing
- [ ] Write small, focused commits
- [ ] Test frequently in the browser
- [ ] Keep your branch up to date with main
- [ ] Follow the project's code style
- [ ] Don't commit sensitive data (API keys, passwords)
- [ ] Comment complex logic

### Before Creating PR
- [ ] Test everything thoroughly
- [ ] Run the linter: `npm run lint`
- [ ] Run tests (if the project has them): `npm test`
- [ ] Build the project: `npm run build`
- [ ] Review your own changes
- [ ] Write a clear PR description

### During Code Review
- [ ] Respond to all comments
- [ ] Ask for clarification if needed
- [ ] Make requested changes promptly
- [ ] Be open to learning

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Fixing a Bug

```bash
# 1. Reproduce the bug locally
# 2. Create bugfix branch
git checkout main
git pull
git checkout -b bugfix/fix-button-crash

# 3. Fix the bug and test
# ... make changes ...

# 4. Commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "fix: prevent crash when button clicked without data"
git push -u origin bugfix/fix-button-crash

# 5. Create PR with:
#    - Description of the bug
#    - What caused it
#    - How you fixed it
#    - How to test the fix
```

### Scenario 2: Adding a New Feature

```bash
# 1. Create feature branch
git checkout main
git pull
git checkout -b feature/add-search-bar

# 2. Break down the feature into steps
# - Create search component
# - Add search functionality
# - Style the component
# - Add to navbar

# 3. Commit after each logical step
git add src/components/SearchBar.tsx
git commit -m "feat: create search bar component skeleton"

git add src/components/SearchBar.tsx
git commit -m "feat: implement search functionality"

git add src/styles/SearchBar.css
git commit -m "style: add styling to search bar"

git add src/components/Navbar.tsx
git commit -m "feat: integrate search bar into navbar"

# 4. Push and create PR
git push -u origin feature/add-search-bar
```

### Scenario 3: Merge Conflicts

```bash
# Your branch is behind main and has conflicts

# 1. Update main
git checkout main
git pull

# 2. Try to merge
git checkout feature/your-feature
git merge main

# 3. Git shows conflicts in files
# CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in src/App.tsx

# 4. Open the file and look for:
# <<<<<<< HEAD
# Your changes
# =======
# Changes from main
# >>>>>>> main

# 5. Edit the file to resolve conflicts
# Remove the markers and keep the correct code

# 6. Mark as resolved
git add src/App.tsx
git commit -m "merge: resolve conflicts with main"
git push
```

## Communication Tips

- **Ask questions** in team chat or meetings
- **Share progress** - Update the team on what you're working on
- **Request help** when stuck for more than 30 minutes
- **Report blockers** - Tell the team if something is preventing your progress
- **Participate in code reviews** - Review others' PRs to learn

## Resources

### Team Resources
