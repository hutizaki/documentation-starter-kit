/**
 * Card object representing a single card with its identity, position, z-index, and photos.
 * 
 * This is the core data structure for the collage system:
 * - id: Never changes (CARD_1, CARD_2, etc.)
 * - position: Changes during shuffles (CENTER, TOP_LEFT, etc.)
 * - zIndex: Changes during every shuffle (rotates: 5→4→3→2→1→0, CENTER always gets 5)
 * - photoIndex: Original photo assignment (immutable, kept for reference)
 * - currentPhotoIndex: The photo currently being displayed (mutable, changes when card reaches CENTER)
 * 
 * Photo Management Strategy:
 * - When a card moves TO CENTER position, it receives a new photo via currentPhotoIndex
 * - The card "holds onto" this photo even when it moves to other visible positions
 * - This creates the illusion of infinite photos cycling through the deck
 * - CENTER_BACK is the exception: it always shows the "next" photo as a buffer
 * 
 * Visual properties (top, left, rotate, flyDirection) come from the position's config,
 * but zIndex is tracked separately per card and overrides the position's default zIndex.
 * All properties are passed to Framer Motion variants which handle animations.
