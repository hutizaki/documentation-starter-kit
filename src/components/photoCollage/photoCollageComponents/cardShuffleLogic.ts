/**
 * Card Shuffle Business Logic
 * 
 * This file contains the core business logic for shuffling cards in the photo collage.
 * It operates on Card objects (id + position) and determines which cards need to
 * swap positions and which animations to apply.
 * 
 * Key Responsibilities:
 * - Find which card is at CENTER position
 * - Determine next/previous card in the sequence
 * - Execute 3-way position rotation
 * - Assign appropriate animation states (fly away vs smooth transition)
 * - Manage z-index updates to prevent visual glitches
 *
 * Architecture:
 * - THREE cards change position per shuffle (3-way rotation)
 * - THREE cards animate per shuffle (1 flies, 2 move smoothly)
 * - Other 3 cards remain stationary

 * 5. Z-indexes updated in two phases to prevent visual glitches
